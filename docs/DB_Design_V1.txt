UI/UX Flow Chart:

UserSignUp-> Email, Password

ShopSignUp-> registrarName, registrarAddress, ShopName, ShopAddress, NumberOfBranch, City, Country -> After Manual Verification-> Open Shop Branches (Number of Branches) -> Register User - Send Signup Link Email to ShopAdmin ShopManager

 and Branch-admin can manage multiple branches
 1 Customer See mobile customer view
 2 Shop-Owner See Mobile employee view, and portal to manage all the branches (shop super admin) Assign employee and branch admin  to branches.
 3 Branch-Employee Only mobile employee view
 4 Branch-admin See Mobile employee view, and portal to manage assigned branch
